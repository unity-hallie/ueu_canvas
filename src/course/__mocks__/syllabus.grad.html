        <h2>Course Description</h2>
    </div>
    <p><span>This course provides an in-depth understanding of animal behavior and learning from biological, physiological, and neurological perspectives. </span><span>&nbsp;Students will explore the mechanisms and processes that govern animal behavior, including neural systems and sensory processes. Students will also explore principles of animal learning, which will include non-associative learning such as habituation, dishabituation and sensitization, and associative learning, which will include classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning.</span><span> The course covers topics on the adaptive value and evolution of behavior, social behavior, communication, and the relationship between behavior and the environment. Students will also learn about the latest research techniques and methods used to study animal behavior and learning. By the end of the course, students will be able to apply their knowledge to real-world situations and problems in animal behavior and learning.</span></p>

Students are also expected to check email at least once every 24 hours. While instructors are not required to have a set list of standard office hours each week, faculty are expected to be available to meet with students to achieve the same goals as typical office hours based on requests from students, and to respond to requests within the response windows described above.</p>
                            <p>Please remember to start assignments early so you have time to ask questions and get answers before the due date. Instructors are encouraged to post announcements at least once a week, so please check your Canvas profile to make sure that Announcements are sent to your preferred communication pathway.</p>
                            <p>While all course-specific communication should take place in Canvas, remember to check your<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="atMention" title="unity">@unity</span>.edu email account regularly for important communication from advisors/concierges and other Unity Environmental University offices.

                        <p class="grad">You are required to actively participate in Canvas Discussions on a weekly basis. You must make your initial discussion post by 3AM ET Thursday (unless otherwise noted in directions) and respond to the postings of the specified number of classmates by the due date. Please bear in mind that you are expected to post meaningfully to the discussion board and are encouraged to participate by posting and/or responding on <strong>different days</strong> during the week to create an active, ongoing discussion. Be sure to check the discussion boards regularly and reply to questions your peers and instructor pose. Please avoid responses such as &ldquo;I agree&rdquo; or &ldquo;I was thinking the same thing&rdquo; as they add little to the discussion. Responses should be closer to 200 words and include constructive feedback, criticism, analysis, review, and/or other specific requirements of the discussion assignment. For more information, please read the discussion assignment descriptions and the grading rubrics.</p>
                        <p>To access a discussion's grading rubric, click on the "View Rubric" button in the discussion directions and/or the "Dot Dot Dot" (for screen readers, titled "Manage this Discussion") button in the upper right corner of the discussion, and then click "show rubric".</p>

Students who believe they may need a disability accommodation should initiate a review by contacting the appropriate resource. For contact information on requesting accommodations, students must go to <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://unity.edu/policies/accessibility-and-ada-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accessibility and ADA Services</a>. The ADA contact will provide an Accessibility and Accommodations Request Form electronically to the student. In addition to completing that form, students will need to provide academic and/or medical documentation. These materials will be assessed, eligibility will be determined, and the Dean or Vice President will contact the student directly to discuss any appropriate accommodations and strategies. All inquiries and information are kept strictly confidential.</p>
