        <h2>Course Description</h2>
    </div>
    <p><span>Ecological Principles: Applications to Conservation is a comprehensive course that delves into the fundamental concepts of ecology and their relevance in addressing contemporary conservation challenges. Through a combination of theoretical instruction and practical applications, students will explore key ecological principles that help explain and mitigate the impacts of climate change, human activities, and invasive species on ecological systems. Through course activities, students will develop a solid foundation in the key principles of ecology and their direct applications to conservation. This knowledge will enable them to contribute effectively to the understanding and management of ecological systems and the preservation of biodiversity.</span></p>

                            <p>The instructor will conduct all correspondence with students related to the class in Canvas, and you should expect to receive a response to emails within 24 hours (48 hours during weekends). Students are also expected to check email at least once every 24 hours. While instructors are not required to have a set list of standard office hours each week, faculty are expected to be available to meet with students to achieve the same goals as typical office hours based on requests from students, and to respond to requests within the response windows described above.</p>
                            <p>Please remember to start assignments early so you have time to ask questions and get answers before the due date. Instructors are encouraged to post announcements at least once a week, so please check your Canvas profile to make sure that Announcements are sent to your preferred communication pathway.</p>
                            <p>While all course-specific communication should take place in Canvas, remember to check your<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="atMention" title="unity">@unity</span>.edu email account regularly for important communication from advisors/concierges and other Unity Environmental University offices.

All Discussions will require you to post on at least two different days during the week: Your initial post by 3am ET Thursday, and your responses by 3am ET Monday. This is to ensure that you and your peers have initial posts in which to respond. If you submit your original post and your peer response on the same day, you will receive credit for only one post.&nbsp;</p>

For contact information on requesting accommodations, students must go to <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://unity.edu/policies/accessibility-and-ada-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accessibility and ADA Services</a>. The ADA contact will provide an Accessibility and Accommodations Request Form electronically to the student. In addition to completing that form, students will need to provide academic and/or medical documentation. These materials will be assessed, eligibility will be determined, and the Dean or Vice President will contact the student directly to discuss any appropriate accommodations and strategies. All inquiries and information are kept strictly confidential.</p>

By joining the Unity Environmental University community, students express their willingness to accept the responsibilities and privileges of the academic community. Furthermore, students understand that their name on any assignment&mdash;written or otherwise&mdash;shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of their own thought and study, except where quotation marks, references, footnotes, or other means of attribution acknowledge the use of other sources.
